2. Manually launch hw_server with -e "set xsdb-user-bscan <C_USER_SCAN_CHAIN scan_chain_number>" to detect the debug hub at User Scan Chain of 2 or 4. To determine the user scan chain setting, open the implemented design and use: get_property C_USER_SCAN_CHAIN [get_debug_cores dbg_hub].

Please use disconnect_hw_server to close the current server connection. Check cable connectivity and that the target board is powered up.
Restart the hw_server application running on host localhost, port 3121 and then use connect_hw_server to re-establish connection to target.
